# U-Net Image Segmentation for Point Cloud Images

This repository contains an implementation of a U-Net model for image segmentation, specifically designed for point cloud images. The model is based on a tutorial from [PyImageSearch](https://pyimagesearch.com/2021/11/08/u-net-training-image-segmentation-models-in-pytorch/).

## Training Data

The model was trained using the ronny_images dataset provided by the [Cloud2DImageConverter](https://github.com/alunos-pfc/Cloud2DImageConverter) project.

## Usage

1. Clone the Repository.
2. Configure Paths: update the paths in the code to point to your own dataset.
